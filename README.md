- Set of all the matlab code used and written to prepare the input data (bathymetry, grid, ECMWF, ... ) to feed nemo to run configurations

- All the Fortran modules that were modified from the original files provided with NEMO, as well as the different namelists used and their description.

- The scientific report written as a conclusion of this internship.

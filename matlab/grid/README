%% OUTPUT : coordinates.nc %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To create the grid we used the SIREN package provided by NEMO

The name of the file created here will be coordinates.nc

The configuration file are  : 

create_coord_coarse.nam
create_coord_fine.nam

We used : 
http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/nemo/doxygen/md_src_docsrc_2_quickstart.html
as a guide.

As opposed to  the tutorial, we created our coordinates.nc file in two steps. That is two say we ran twice the SIREN TOOL. First to get the 
coord_coarse.nc file
the to get the 
coord_fine.nc file

_____________________________________________

I. Compile the SIREN TOOL

While in the <path>/NEMOGCM/TOOLS/ folder, do : 
> ./maketools -m linux -j4  -n SIREN


We choose to work with SIREN in a new folder named : TEST
> mkdir <path>/NEMOGCM/TOOLS/SIREN/TEST

II.  Modify the .nam files 

Adapt the paths in the create_coord_coarse.nam file.

III.  Create the coarse grid

While in the <path>/NEMOGCM/TOOLS/SIREN folder, do :

> <path>/NEMOGCM/TOOLS/SIREN/create_coord.exe create_coord_coarse.nam 

IV. Create the fine Grid 

> <path>/NEMOGCM/TOOLS/SIREN/create_coord.exe create_coord_fine.nam 


V.   Possible Issues    

If a problem occur, running : 
> ulimit -s unlimited 
can be useful (https://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/nemo/discussion/topic/43#message_77)

Be careful to change the name of your output file if you run several time the same line. Otherwise there will be an error.
